FACTORYAL is an innovative start-up operating in the market of factory automation software. It is part of the EXOR International group and a spin-off company from the University of Verona.

It proposes a modular software suite focusing on three main aspects:
- Facilitate the integration of different pieces of equipment in a running factory, reducing the complexity of configuration and the necessity of manual labor;
- Enable a new degree of flexibility of production systems, by proposing efficient reconfiguration strategies that can respond to both macro market changes and micro breakouts of machines during production;
- Analyze actual and historical production data, to identify inefficiencies and to propose a viable solution for systems optimization.
